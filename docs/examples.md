# Examples

Build the project using the [installation guide](installation.md). Run the `pnpm atlascode` commands below from the source root. For interactive tasks, open the target project directory and launch the built CLI by absolute path.

## 1. Edit code and run tests

`examples/clamp` is an intentionally broken exercise with one function and three Node.js tests. It needs no additional dependencies. Copy the directory to a temporary location, open that copy, and start:

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/atlascode/dist/cli.js
```

Enter:

> Read clamp.mjs and clamp.test.mjs. Run node --test to reproduce the failure, fix clamp without changing the tests, then run the tests again.

In the [real demo](demo.md), two tests initially failed. After correcting the bounds, all three passed. Use `Ctrl+O` to inspect tool details. Choose permissions appropriate for your project; the demo ran in a temporary directory containing only synthetic files.

Resume the most recent session in the current directory:

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/atlascode/dist/cli.js --continue
```

## 2. Choose your own model

Use `/provider` in the interactive TUI to select a configured model. Before adding a custom provider, set a key in your current shell rather than putting it in command arguments or source:

```bash
# POSIX shell: read the key interactively without echoing it.
read -s ATLASCODE_PROVIDER_API_KEY
export ATLASCODE_PROVIDER_API_KEY
```

In PowerShell, use a process environment variable and treat the input as sensitive:

```powershell
$secureKey = Read-Host 'API Key' -AsSecureString
$env:ATLASCODE_PROVIDER_API_KEY = [System.Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $secureKey).Password
```

Add, inspect, and test the provider:

```bash
pnpm atlascode provider add --name my-provider --base-url https://example.com/v1 \
  --api-format openai-completions --model my-model \
  --api-key-env ATLASCODE_PROVIDER_API_KEY --use
pnpm atlascode provider list
pnpm atlascode provider test <provider-id> --model <model-id>
pnpm atlascode exec "Explain this project's test entry points" --model <provider-id>/<model-id>
```

Replace the example URL, model name, and IDs with your configuration and the IDs returned by the list command. `--use` tests the first listed model, then saves the provider and selects that model as the default. A failed connection test exits nonzero without saving or changing the default; correct the URL, key, or first model ID and retry. Omit `--use` to save without a connection test or default-model change. `exec --model` overrides only the current run. Backslash line continuations are for POSIX shells; use a single line in PowerShell.

For a local server, configure its actual token limits explicitly:

```bash
pnpm atlascode provider add --name local-models --base-url http://localhost:8080/v1 \
  --api-format openai-completions --model local-model --model another-model \
  --api-key-env ATLASCODE_PROVIDER_API_KEY \
  --context-limit 32768 --output-limit 4096 --use
pnpm atlascode provider list --json
```

`--context-limit` and `--output-limit` each accept a positive safe integer (at most `9007199254740991`). Either flag can be used independently. The same limits apply to every repeated `--model`; only the first model is tested and selected by `--use`. The JSON list shows the configured values as `contextLimit` and `maxOutputTokens`. Without these flags, the existing defaults remain unchanged (unknown custom models currently fall back to 200,000 context tokens and 16,384 output tokens). Model discovery does not infer your local server's context size.

[Live acceptance](verification.md) separately verified MiniMax Token Plan and one configured BYOK provider. This is not a guarantee for every compatible service.

## 3. Search and image input

After signing in to MiniMax, try a task that explicitly requires search:

> Use web_search to find the official Node.js test runner documentation. Summarize how to run tests and include the source URL. If the tool is unavailable, say so.

Acceptance observed an actual `web_search` call and returned results; see the [verification record](verification.md). A model returning a URL alone does not prove it used search.

Paste your own image into the TUI, or attach a file explicitly:

```bash
pnpm atlascode exec "Describe this UI screenshot's layout and suggest three improvements" \
  --file /absolute/path/to/your-screenshot.png
```

The image is sent as input to the selected model service. Use content suitable for sending and a model that supports images. This is an executable usage example, not a live-service acceptance result from this review. Search, image understanding, and media generation are separate capabilities; atlascode-tools generation also requires the relevant account permissions and credits.

Use `/plugins` to manage extensions. See [capability coverage](tui-capabilities.md) for custom MCP, managed connectors, and media tools.
