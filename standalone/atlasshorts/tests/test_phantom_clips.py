"""A clip that never rendered must not be reported as delivered.

The metadata JSON is written BEFORE the clips render, and main.py's worker pool
swallows a per-clip exception (it only prints "❌ Clip N failed") and still
exits 0. app.py then rebuilt the job result from that metadata and named every
clip through _canonical_clip_file, which returns a name whether or not the file
exists. A job whose renders all failed was therefore reported as completed with
N clips: the minutes were committed, ClipsDelivered fired, archive_job skipped
every missing file and uploaded the metadata alone (returning before it writes
the Project row, so the job could not even be restored), and the dashboard
offered clips whose only existence was a title — "download all" then answered
404 "No clip files found for this job".

Reported as ticket #4711 (job 89d76bbc, 6-sep-2026): two titles, two viral
scores, blank players, and 404 on download. Measured over the R2 archive on
7-sep-2026: 195 of 1687 archived jobs held a metadata file and not one clip,
across 184 users.
